## Go Portfolio tracker
I want to learn golang and I want to build something where I can:
- view all my porfolios in one place
- pull historical trade data into local storage
- aggregation to get average buy price and average sale price
- calculate fees in my trades
- dashboard to view all of these with a reasonable refresh time
